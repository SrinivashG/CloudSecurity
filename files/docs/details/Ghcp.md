To maximize your productivity with GitHub Copilot, consider the following tips and tricks:

Use specific and well-crafted prompts to get more relevant code suggestions. Start with a general request and then add specific details, such as required libraries, naming conventions, or constraints like avoiding recursion.
 Providing examples of expected input and output can significantly improve the quality of the generated code.
 For instance, when asking for a function to count vowels, include example calls and their results.

Leverage the power of context by keeping relevant files open in your editor. Copilot analyzes the current open files to understand the project's context, which helps generate more accurate suggestions.
 You can also use the #codebase variable in your chat prompts to let Copilot search your entire codebase for relevant files.
 Dragging and dropping files, folders, or editor tabs directly into the chat prompt adds specific context.

Utilize the built-in slash commands in Copilot Chat to perform common tasks efficiently.
 For example, use /explain to get a description of a code block, /fix to propose a solution for problematic code, /tests to generate unit tests, /doc to add documentation comments, /optimize to improve code performance, /simplify to reduce complexity, /new to scaffold a new project, and /clear to reset the conversation.

Personalize Copilot's behavior by creating instructions files. These Markdown files, placed in a .github/instructions folder, allow you to define your project's coding practices, such as preferred libraries, naming conventions, and testing frameworks.
 This ensures Copilot's suggestions align with your team's standards.

Enhance your workflow by using prompt files to save and reuse complex, task-specific prompts.
 Create a .prompt.md file with the necessary context and instructions, and then run it using the / command followed by the prompt file name.
 This is especially useful for repetitive tasks like generating React components or setting up new projects.

Finally, integrate Copilot into your code review process. When reviewing a pull request, use the Copilot icon to ask for suggestions on refactoring repetitive code or improving best practices for a specific language.
 This can save time and provide actionable feedback.

AI has become an integral part of my workflow these days, and with the assistance of GitHub Copilot, I move a lot faster when I’m building a project. Having used AI tools to increase my productivity over the past year, I’ve realized that similar to learning how to use a new framework or library, we can enhance our efficiency with AI tools by learning how to best use them.

In this blog post, I’ll share some of the daily things I do to get the most out of GitHub Copilot. I hope these tips will help you become a more efficient and productive user of the AI assistant.

Need a refresher on how to use GitHub Copilot?
Since GitHub Copilot continues to evolve in the IDE, CLI, and across GitHub.com, we put together a full guide on using GitHub Copilot with prompt tips and tricks. Get the guide >

Want to learn how best to leverage it in the IDE? Keep on reading. ⤵

Beyond code completion
To make full use of the power of GitHub Copilot, it’s important to understand its capabilities. GitHub Copilot is developing rapidly, and new features are being added all the time. It’s no longer just a code completion tool in your editor—it now includes a chat interface that you can use in your IDE, a command line tool via a GitHub CLI extension, a summary tool in your pull requests, a helper tool in your terminals, and much, much more.

In a recent blog post, I’ve listed some of the ways you didn’t know you could use GitHub Copilot. This will give you a great overview of how much the AI assistant can currently do.



But beyond interacting with GitHub Copilot, how do you help it give you better answers? Well, the answer to that needs a bit more context.

Context, context, context
If you understand Large Language Models ( LLMs), you will know that they are designed to make predictions based on the context provided. This means, the more contextually rich our input or prompt is, the better the prediction or output will be.

As such, learning to provide as much context as possible is key when interacting with GitHub Copilot, especially with the code completion feature. Unlike ChatGPT where you need to provide all the data to the model in the prompt window, by installing GitHub Copilot in your editor, the assistant is able to infer context from the code you’re working on. It then uses that context to provide code suggestions.

We already know this, but what else can we do to give it additional context?

I want to share a few essential tips with you to provide GitHub Copilot with more context in your editor to get the most relevant and useful code out of it:

1. Open your relevant files
Having your files open provides GitHub Copilot with context. When you have additional files open, it will help to inform the suggestion that is returned. Remember, if a file is closed, GitHub Copilot cannot see the file’s content in your editor, which means it cannot get the context from those closed files.

GitHub Copilot looks at the current open files in your editor to analyze the context, create a prompt that gets sent to the server, and return an appropriate suggestion.

Have a few files open in your editor to give GitHub Copilot a bigger picture of your project. You can also use #editor in the chat interface to provide GitHub Copilot with additional context on your currently opened files in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Visual Studio.

Remember to close unneeded files when context switching or moving on to the next task.

2. Provide a top-level comment
Just as you would give a brief, high-level introduction to a coworker, a top-level comment in the file you’re working in can help GitHub Copilot understand the overall context of the pieces you will be creating—especially if you want your AI assistant to generate the boilerplate code for you to get going.

Be sure to include details about what you need and provide a good description so it has as much information as possible. This will help to guide GitHub Copilot to give better suggestions, and give it a goal on what to work on. Having examples, especially when processing data or manipulation strings, helps quite a bit.

3. Set Includes and references
It’s best to manually set the includes/imports or module references you need for your work, particularly if you’re working with a specific version of a package.

GitHub Copilot will make suggestions, but you know what dependencies you want to use. This can also help to let GitHub Copilot know what frameworks, libraries, and their versions you’d like it to use when crafting suggestions.

This can be helpful to jump start GitHub Copilot to a newer library version when it defaults to providing older code suggestions.

4. Meaningful names matter
The name of your variables and functions matter. If you have a function named foo or bar, GitHub Copilot will not be able to give you the best completion because it isn’t able to infer intent from the names.

Just as the function name fetchData() won’t mean much to a coworker (or you after a few months), fetchData() won’t mean much to GitHub Copilot either.

Implementing good coding practices will help you get the most value from GitHub Copilot. While GitHub Copilot helps you code and iterate faster, remember the old rule of programming still applies: garbage in, garbage out.

function named "fetchAirports" that gets data from the /airport route and returns json output of airports to demonstrate meaningful names.

5. Provide specific and well- scoped function comments
Commenting your code helps you get very specific, targeted suggestions.

A function name can only be so descriptive without being overly long, so function comments can help fill in details that GitHub Copilot might need to know. One of the neat features about GitHub Copilot is that it can determine the correct comment syntax that is typically used in your programming language for function / method comments and will help create them for you based on what the code does. Adding more detail to these as the first change you do then helps GitHub Copilot determine what you would like to do in code and how to interact with that function.

Remember: Single, specific, short comments help GitHub Copilot provide better context.

6. Provide sample code
Providing sample code to GitHub Copilot will help it determine what you’re looking for. This helps to ground the model and provide it with even more context.

It also helps GitHub Copilot generate suggestions that match the language and tasks you want to achieve, and return suggestions based on your current coding standards and practices. Unit tests provide one level of sample code at the individual function/method level, but you can also provide code examples in your project showing how to do things end to end. The cool thing about using GitHub Copilot long-term is that it nudges us to do a lot of the good coding practices we should’ve been doing all along.

Learn more about providing context to GitHub Copilot by watching this Youtube video:



Inline Chat with GitHub Copilot
Inline chat
Outside of providing enough context, there are some built-in features of GitHub Copilot that you may not be taking advantage of. Inline chat, for example, gives you an opportunity to almost chat with GitHub Copilot between your lines of code. By pressing CMD + I (CTRL + I on Windows) you’ll have Copilot right there to ask questions. This is a bit more convenient for quick fixes instead of opening up GitHub Copilot Chat’s side panel.

This experience provides you with code diffs inline, which is awesome. There are also special slash commands available like creating documentation with just the slash of a button!

Tips and tricks with GitHub Copilot Chat
GitHub Copilot Chat provides an experience in your editor where you can have a conversation with the AI assistant. You can improve this experience by using built-in features to make the most out of it.

8. Remove irrelevant requests
For example, did you know that you can delete a previously asked question in the chat interface to remove it from the indexed conversation? Especially if it is no longer relevant?

Copilot Chat interface with a mouse click hovered over a conversation and the X button to delete it.

Doing this will improve the flow of conversation and give GitHub Copilot only the necessary information needed to provide you with the best output.

9. Navigate through your conversation
Another tip I found is to use the up and down arrows to navigate through your conversation with GitHub Copilot Chat. I found myself scrolling through the chat interface to find that last question I asked, then discovered I can just use my keyboard arrows just like in the terminal!

10. Use the @workspace agent
If you’re using VS Code or Visual Studio, remember that agents are available to help you go even further. The @workspace agent for example, is aware of your entire workspace and can answer questions related to it. As such, it can provide even more context when trying to get a good output from GitHub Copilot.

11. Highlight relevant code
Another great tip when using GitHub Copilot Chat is to highlight relevant code in your files before asking it questions. This will help to give targeted suggestions and just provides the assistant with more context into what you need help with.

12. Organize your conversations with threads
You can have multiple ongoing conversations with GitHub Copilot Chat on different topics by isolating your conversations with threads. We’ve provided a convenient way for you to start new conversations (thread) by clicking the + sign on the chat interface.

13. Slash Commands for common tasks
Slash commands are awesome, and there are quite a few of them. We have commands to help you explain code, fix code, create a new notebook, write tests, and many more. They are just shortcuts to common prompts that we’ve found to be particularly helpful in day-to-day development from our own internal usage.

Agent mode leverages GitHub Copilot's ability to create and edit files automatically. For Azure Policy development, this means:[2][3]

- **Automated Code Generation**: Generate complete Bicep or ARM templates for policy definitions
- **File Creation**: Automatically create parameter files, assignment templates, and documentation
- **Project Structure**: Set up organized folder structures for policy-as-code implementations

## Practical Implementation Strategies

### **1. Policy Definition Development**

**Generate Custom Policy Definitions**:[4][5]
```
@azure Create a Bicep template for an Azure Policy that restricts VM SKUs to specific sizes
@azure Generate an ARM template for a policy that enforces specific tags on storage accounts
```

GitHub Copilot can generate complete policy definitions including:
- Policy rules with proper condition logic
- Parameters for flexibility
- Metadata for documentation
- Appropriate mode settings (All, Indexed, etc.)

**Transform Existing Policies**:[6]
Use agent mode to convert ARM templates to Bicep or vice versa:
```
Transform these ARM policy templates to Bicep format and organize them in a modular structure
```

### **2. Bicep Template Generation for Policies**

GitHub Copilot excels at creating Bicep templates for Azure Policy deployment:[7][8]

```bicep
// Example generated by Copilot
@description('Policy to restrict allowed locations')
param allowedLocations array = ['eastus', 'westus']

resource locationPolicy 'Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions@2023-04-01' = {
  name: 'restrict-locations-policy'
  properties: {
    displayName: 'Allowed locations'
    policyType: 'Custom'
    mode: 'All'
    parameters: {
      allowedLocations: {
        type: 'Array'
        metadata: {
          description: 'The list of allowed locations for resources'
        }
      }
    }
    policyRule: {
      if: {
        not: {
          field: 'location'
          in: '[parameters(\'allowedLocations\')]'
        }
      }
      then: {
        effect: 'deny'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **3. Policy Assignment and Management**

**Assignment Templates**:[9]
Generate templates for policy assignments at various scopes:
```
@azure Create a Bicep template to assign a policy initiative to a subscription with specific parameters
@azure Generate ARM template for resource group-level policy assignment

```

**Policy Compliance Investigation**:
```
@azure Help me write a query to find all non-compliant resources for a specific policy
@azure Generate a script to remediate non-compliant resources
```

## Best Practices for Maximum Effectiveness

### **7. Prompt Engineering for Policy Development**

**Be Specific**: Include context about your governance requirements
```
@azure Create a policy for a healthcare organization that ensures all storage accounts have encryption at rest and specific network access rules for HIPAA compliance
```

**Iterative Refinement**: Use follow-up prompts to refine generated policies
```
@azure Modify that policy to include exceptions for certain resource groups
@azure Add a parameter to make the encryption type configurable
```

### **8. Integration with Azure Governance Tools**

**Azure Resource Graph Integration**:[15]
```

Absolutely! Now that your Azure Policies are established and aligned with enterprise standards, let’s explore how **GitHub Copilot**—especially **GitHub Copilot for Azure** in Agent Mode—can further amplify your productivity, governance, and policy-as-code workflows.

---

## 1. Copilot's Enterprise-Grade Capabilities

* **Best-in-Class Coding Assistant:** GitHub Copilot, powered by GPT-4 (now GPT‑4o), offers deep IDE integrations across VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains, Vim, and more. It accesses your project context and enterprise knowledge base to deliver smarter, context-aware suggestions. ([TechRadar][1])
* **Enterprise Data Integration & Privacy:** On enterprise plans, Copilot can tap into your own repositories and documentation (like wikis, policy docs, Azure Policy JSONs) to tailor outputs. By default, it doesn't feed usage data back to train the model, giving you more data control. ([TechRadar][1], [The Verge][2], [GitHub Docs][3])

---

## 2. Copilot for Azure (Agent Mode)—A Supercharged Assistant for Policy-as-Code

With **GitHub Copilot for Azure now generally available**, Agent Mode transforms Copilot into a proactive DevOps teammate capable of:

* Generating infrastructure-as-code (IaC) artifacts (e.g., policy definitions in Bicep or ARM) using natural language.
* Reading your actual Azure tenant resources for situational context.
* Executing multi-step workflows: scaffolding, deploying, refactoring, and troubleshooting—all from VS Code. ([Microsoft for Developers][4])

### Real Use Cases Tailored for Azure Policy:

* **Scaffold Policy-as-Code:**
  *“Generate a Bicep file for a policy that enforces tag `Environment` at management group level.”* Copilot can auto-create the template—including parameters and examples.

* **Context-Aware Validation:**
  *“List all policy assignments across subscriptions matching the `baseline-init` initiative.”* Copilot can run queries and return real-time data—even shape code for dashboards or remediation.

* **Automate Assignments & Deployment:** Deploy policy definitions and assignments directly through agent-generated CLI or ARM commands, reducing manual toil.

---

## 3. Additional Productivity Enhancements

* **Pull Request Summaries & Review Assistance:** Copilot can summarize PR changes relevant to policy-as-code updates—highlighting added definitions, modifications, or scope changes. ([GitHub Docs][3], [The Verge][2])

* **Custom Prompting and Knowledge Integration:** Embed your enterprise’s style guides, naming conventions, or policy standards in a **Copilot knowledge base** for more consistent and compliant code generation. ([GitHub Docs][3])

* **Multi-Modal LLM Support:** You can choose among GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or the o1 model family depending on your compliance and reasoning needs, managed via Copilot policies. ([GitHub Docs][3])

---

## 4. Governance Controls & Enterprise Safety

* **Feature Management:** Enterprise owners can enforce Copilot features—like Chat, CLI integration, and specific model access—across the organization. These policies cascade down to teams. ([GitHub Docs][3])

* **Coding Agent Control:** Enable or restrict the Copilot coding agent that can autonomously generate and push code—helping secure sensitive policy repos. ([GitHub Docs][5])

* **Data Security:** Copilot avoids feeding internal code into public models and respects data encryption. Still, you retain tight control over which models to enable and how they access your environment. ([TechRadar][1], [The Verge][2])

---

## 5. Productivity Gains: Reflections from Research & Users

* **Developer Speed:** Teams using Copilot complete tasks \~55% faster than those without it. ([arXiv][6])

* **Enterprise Satisfaction & Workflow Efficiency:** GitHub’s own surveys note that Copilot dramatically improves onboarding, developer happiness, and workflow fluidity — even summarizing PRs to reduce churn. ([The Verge][2])
