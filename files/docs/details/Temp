Subject: Update: Automation for Azure Policies QA/QC Report

Hi Mahesh,

I wanted to share an update on the QA/QC report automation for Azure policies. Initially, this process was manual, which involved significant effort and potential for errors. To streamline this, we explored automation approaches.

We first began with Python for the automation. While we were able to make progress, we encountered a few challenges along the way. Around the same time, when you shared the PowerShell modules for Azure, we decided to explore that route as well.

Using the PowerShell modules, we set up the required environment and successfully created a script that generates the Azure policies report for a tenant. In parallel, the Python-based automation was also completed, and we now have reports being generated through that approach too.

Positive Outcomes:

We now have two working approaches (Python and PowerShell) for automating QA/QC reports, reducing manual effort and improving accuracy.

The PowerShell approach leverages native Azure modules, making it a strong option for future enhancements and integration.

This exercise helped us build knowledge on both scripting tools for Azure automation.

GitHub Copilot was used to assist with parts of the scripting process.


Iâ€™m sharing the details of the steps we followed and the script link here for your reference:

Please let us know your thoughts or if there are any additional improvements we should consider.

Thanks for your guidance and support in this process.
