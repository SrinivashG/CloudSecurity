# Scenario-Based Questions with Answers

## **Terraform**
### General Scenarios
1. **How would you manage state files in a team environment to ensure no conflicts while applying Terraform configurations?**  
   **Solution:** Use a remote backend like Amazon S3 with DynamoDB for state locking. The DynamoDB table acts as a lock mechanism to prevent concurrent updates.

2. **Explain how you would safely roll back a failed Terraform deployment.**  
   **Solution:** Use the `terraform state rollback` or deploy a previous version of the configuration from your version control system. Always backup the state file before changes.

3. **How do you structure Terraform code for a multi-environment setup (e.g., dev, stage, prod)?**  
   **Solution:** Use separate directories (`environments/dev`, `environments/stage`) or workspaces for each environment. Keep shared modules in a `modules/` directory.

4. **What would you do if a colleague accidentally deleted the Terraform state file?**  
   **Solution:** Restore the state file from a remote backend or retrieve the latest backup. Always enable versioning for remote state storage.

5. **How would you refactor a large Terraform project with multiple modules?**  
   **Solution:** Break the project into logically grouped modules (e.g., networking, compute). Use module versioning and outputs for inter-module communication.

### Security Scenarios
1. **How do you securely store sensitive data like API keys or passwords in Terraform?**  
   **Solution:** Use a secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager) or environment variables. Avoid hardcoding secrets in `.tf` files.

2. **How would you ensure that Terraform doesn’t expose sensitive data in its logs?**  
   **Solution:** Use the `sensitive` attribute for variables. Example:  
   ```hcl
   variable "password" {
     type      = string
     sensitive = true
   }
   ```

3. **What is your approach to ensuring that there are no hardcoded secrets in Terraform files?**  
   **Solution:** Use static analysis tools like `TFSec` or `Checkov` to scan for hardcoded secrets during CI/CD.

4. **How do you implement access control to Terraform state files stored in remote backends?**  
   **Solution:** Use IAM policies to restrict access to the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table. Enable encryption for the state file.

5. **How would you identify and mitigate potential drift between Terraform-managed infrastructure and manually changed resources?**  
   **Solution:** Use the `terraform plan` command regularly and enable drift detection tools like AWS Config.

## **Kubernetes**
### General Scenarios
1. **How would you handle a situation where a Kubernetes pod is stuck in a `CrashLoopBackOff` state?**  
   **Solution:** Check the pod logs using `kubectl logs <pod-name>` to identify the root cause. Validate resource limits, readiness/liveness probes, and image versions.

2. **Describe your approach to scaling a Kubernetes cluster to handle sudden traffic spikes.**  
   **Solution:** Use the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale pods based on CPU/memory usage. Enable Cluster Autoscaler to scale the nodes.

3. **What would you do if a Kubernetes service is not routing traffic to the appropriate pods?**  
   **Solution:** Verify the service selector matches pod labels. Check endpoints using `kubectl describe svc` and network policies.

4. **How would you troubleshoot a situation where a pod can’t connect to an external database?**  
   **Solution:** Check ConfigMaps/Secrets for connection settings. Validate network policies and DNS resolution inside the pod.

5. **Explain your approach to upgrading a Kubernetes cluster without downtime.**  
   **Solution:** Use rolling updates for workloads. Upgrade nodes gradually while ensuring workloads are drained and rescheduled.

### Security Scenarios
1. **How would you restrict access to the Kubernetes API server?**  
   **Solution:** Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and network access restrictions like IP whitelisting.

2. **What steps would you take to secure communication between pods in a cluster?**  
   **Solution:** Enable mutual TLS using a service mesh like Istio or Linkerd. Use Kubernetes NetworkPolicies to restrict pod communication.

3. **How do you ensure that container images used in Kubernetes are secure?**  
   **Solution:** Scan images with tools like Trivy or Clair. Use a private registry and enforce image signing with Notary.

4. **What is your approach to enforcing security policies using tools like PodSecurityPolicies or OPA (Open Policy Agent)?**  
   **Solution:** Define PodSecurityPolicies to enforce privilege restrictions. Use OPA Gatekeeper to validate policies during admission.

5. **How would you detect and mitigate a compromised pod in a Kubernetes cluster?**  
   **Solution:** Use runtime security tools like Falco to monitor suspicious activity. Isolate the pod and analyze logs for forensic investigation.

---

## **Docker**
### General Scenarios
1. **How would you troubleshoot a situation where a Docker container is not starting as expected?**  
   **Solution:** Check container logs using `docker logs <container-id>`. Validate the Dockerfile and inspect resource limits.

2. **Explain how you would optimize a Docker image to reduce its size.**  
   **Solution:** Use multi-stage builds to reduce unnecessary files. Use smaller base images like `alpine`.

3. **What is your approach to handling persistent storage for Docker containers?**  
   **Solution:** Use Docker volumes or bind mounts for persistent data. Example:  
   ```bash
   docker run -v /host/path:/container/path my-app
   ```

4. **How would you manage versioning for Docker images in a CI/CD pipeline?**  
   **Solution:** Use semantic versioning (`v1.0.0`) or commit hashes as image tags.

5. **Describe your strategy for migrating applications from a virtual machine to Docker.**  
   **Solution:** Containerize application dependencies gradually. Use tools like `dockerize` to adapt configurations.

### Security Scenarios
1. **How do you ensure that only trusted images are used in your Docker environment?**  
   **Solution:** Use a private registry and enforce image signing with Docker Content Trust.

2. **What measures would you take to secure Docker containers running sensitive applications?**  
   **Solution:** Use non-root users in Dockerfiles. Enable AppArmor/SELinux profiles for isolation.

3. **How do you handle secrets (e.g., API keys) securely in a Docker environment?**  
   **Solution:** Use Docker secrets or environment variables. Avoid hardcoding secrets in Dockerfiles.

4. **How would you prevent privilege escalation within a Docker container?**  
   **Solution:** Add the `no-new-privileges` flag when running containers. Example:  
   ```bash
   docker run --security-opt no-new-privileges my-app
   ```

5. **What is your approach to scanning Docker images for vulnerabilities?**  
   **Solution:** Use tools like Trivy, Clair, or Aqua Security for vulnerability scanning.

2. **What measures would you take to secure a containerized application in the cloud?**  
   **Solution:** Use private registries, scan container images, and enforce network policies for pod communication.

3. **How do you use cloud-native tools (e.g., AWS GuardDuty or Azure Security Center) for threat detection?**  
   **Solution:** Enable these services to monitor for suspicious activity. Integrate findings into a SIEM (e.g., Splunk).

4. **What is your approach to securing serverless functions against injection attacks?**  
   **Solution:** Validate inputs and sanitize data. Use environment variables securely and implement least privilege IAM roles.

5. **How do you ensure that cloud resources are compliant with security best practices during provisioning?**  
   **Solution:** Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning tools like Checkov or Terraform Cloud Sentinel.


   # Scenario-Based Security Question Bank for Modern Cloud-Native Engineering  

Before diving into the questions, remember one principle spans the entire stack: **shift security left, enforce least-privilege everywhere, and automate guard-rails in code**.[1][2]

## Terraform  

1. **Insecure state file on S3**  
   *Question* Your organization keeps `terraform.tfstate` in a public S3 bucket to simplify collaboration. How do you stop the exposure without breaking workflows?  
   *Answer* Move the backend to an S3 bucket with bucket-level AES-256 encryption, enable server-side KMS keys, turn on object-lock versioning, restrict access through an IAM role assumed only by the CI runner, and add a DynamoDB lock table for concurrency.[3][4][5]

2. **Compromised public module**  
   *Question* A junior engineer adds an unpinned community module that later proves malicious. What layered controls avoid this next time?  
   *Answer* Pin every provider and module to a specific version, cache only vetted modules in a private registry, and run Checkov/TFSec scans in the pull-request gate to detect wildcards or hash mismatches.[4][6][7]

3. **Hard-coded secrets in variables**  
   *Question* Someone pushed an RDS password into `var.db_pass`. Fix the pipeline.  
   *Answer* Mark the variable as `sensitive = true`, pull the value at runtime from AWS Secrets Manager via the `data "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version"` data source, and enable Terraform Cloud workspaces with restricted environment variables.[8][5][9]

4. **Privilege escalation through IAM policy**  
   *Question* An over-permissive `aws_iam_role` hands attackers `iam:PassRole`. Contain the blast radius.  
   *Answer* Enforce least-privilege policies generated by IAM Access Analyzer, scan for high-risk actions with `tfsec`, and add Sentinel or OPA policies that block `*` actions during `terraform plan`.[5][6][2]

5. **State drift detection**  
   *Question* A production VPC was modified manually and is now non-compliant. How do you detect and prevent drift?  
   *Answer* Schedule `terraform plan -detailed-exitcode` in the CI pipeline, alert on exit code 2, and enable AWS Config rules to detect out-of-band changes, auto-remediating via `terraform apply` in a guarded job.[10][2][5]

## Kubernetes

### Using This Bank  

-  Mix and match scenarios in mock interviews or brown-bag drills.  
-  Require candidates (or teams) to articulate *detection, containment, and prevention* for each situation.  
-  Probe for trade-offs: cost vs. control, velocity vs. security, managed vs. self-hosted.  

By grounding questions in concrete failure modes you will surface the depth of a practitioner’s **defense-in-depth mindset** and their ability to weave security seamlessly into modern infrastructure-as-code and continuous delivery pipelines.[2][28][1]

# Complete DevOps & Cloud Security Scenarios with Solutions

## Terraform Scenarios & Solutions

### 1. Multi-Environment Deployment

**Scenario**: You need to deploy identical infrastructure across dev, staging, and production environments with different configurations. How would you structure your Terraform code to avoid duplication while maintaining environment-specific customizations?

**Solution**:
```hcl
# Directory structure:
# ├── modules/
# │   └── app-infrastructure/
# │       ├── main.tf
# │       ├── variables.tf
# │       └── outputs.tf
# ├── environments/
# │   ├── dev/
# │   ├── staging/
# │   └── prod/
# └── terraform.tfvars.example

# modules/app-infrastructure/main.tf
resource "aws_instance" "app" {
  count           = var.instance_count
  ami             = var.ami_id
  instance_type   = var.instance_type
  subnet_id       = var.subnet_ids[count.index % length(var.subnet_ids)]
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.app.id]
  
  tags = merge(var.common_tags, {
    Name = "${var.environment}-app-${count.index + 1}"
  })
}

# environments/prod/main.tf
module "app_infrastructure" {
  source = "../../modules/app-infrastructure"
  
  environment     = "prod"
  instance_count  = 3
  instance_type   = "t3.large"
  ami_id          = var.prod_ami_id
  
  common_tags = {
    Environment = "prod"
    Project     = var.project_name
    Owner       = var.team_name
  }
}

# Use terraform workspaces or separate state files
terraform workspace new prod
terraform workspace select prod
```

### 2. State File Recovery

**Scenario**: Your team accidentally corrupted the Terraform state file for a critical production environment. The infrastructure is still running, but Terraform can't manage it.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Step 1: Backup the corrupted state
cp terraform.tfstate terraform.tfstate.corrupted.bak

# Step 2: Create a new empty state
terraform init -reconfigure

# Step 3: Import existing resources
# First, identify all resources that need to be imported
aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,Tags[?Key==`Name`].Value|[0]]' --output table

# Import each resource individually
terraform import aws_instance.web i-1234567890abcdef0
terraform import aws_security_group.web_sg sg-0123456789abcdef0

# Step 4: Verify the state
terraform plan
# Should show "No changes" if import was successful

# Step 5: Use terraform import with for_each for multiple resources
# Create a script to automate imports
cat > import.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
for instance_id in $(aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].InstanceId' --output text); do
  terraform import "aws_instance.web[\"$instance_id\"]" $instance_id
done
EOF
```

### 3. Terraform Security - Secrets Management

**Scenario**: Your Terraform configuration needs to create resources that require sensitive data without exposing them in state files or version control.

**Solution**:
```hcl
# Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
data "aws_ssm_parameter" "db_password" {
  name            = "/myapp/prod/db_password"
  with_decryption = true
}

resource "aws_db_instance" "main" {
  identifier     = "myapp-db"
  engine         = "mysql"
  engine_version = "8.0"
  instance_class = "db.t3.micro"
  
  # Use the retrieved password
  password = data.aws_ssm_parameter.db_password.value
  
  # Other configurations...
  skip_final_snapshot = true
}

# Alternative: Use random password generation
resource "random_password" "db_password" {
  length  = 16
  special = true
}

resource "aws_ssm_parameter" "db_password" {
  name  = "/myapp/${var.environment}/db_password"
  type  = "SecureString"
  value = random_password.db_password.result
}

# For Terraform Cloud/Enterprise
variable "db_password" {
  description = "Database password"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}

# Mark outputs as sensitive
output "db_endpoint" {
  value     = aws_db_instance.main.endpoint
  sensitive = false
}

output "db_password" {
  value     = random_password.db_password.result
  sensitive = true
}
```

## Kubernetes Scenarios & Solutions

### 4. Pod Scheduling Troubleshooting

**Scenario**: Your application pods are not being scheduled on certain nodes despite having available resources. The nodes show as "Ready" but pods remain in "Pending" state.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Step 1: Check pod status and events
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp

# Step 2: Check node conditions and capacity
kubectl describe nodes
kubectl top nodes

# Step 3: Common issues and solutions

# Issue: Node taints
kubectl describe node <node-name> | grep -A5 Taints
# Solution: Add tolerations to pod spec
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  tolerations:
  - key: "dedicated"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "app"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: nginx

# Issue: Resource requests exceeding available capacity
# Check actual resource usage vs requests
kubectl describe node <node-name> | grep -A10 "Allocated resources"

# Solution: Adjust resource requests or add more nodes
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: nginx
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "500m"

# Issue: Node selectors or affinity rules
# Check for nodeSelector or affinity constraints
kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o yaml | grep -A10 nodeSelector

# Issue: PodDisruptionBudget preventing scheduling
kubectl get pdb --all-namespaces
```

### 5. Kubernetes Security - RBAC Implementation

**Scenario**: A developer accidentally deleted critical resources because they had cluster-admin privileges. Implement proper RBAC to prevent this while ensuring developers can still work effectively.

**Solution**:
```yaml
# Create namespace-specific roles
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: development
  name: developer-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods", "services", "configmaps", "secrets"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
- apiGroups: ["apps"]
  resources: ["deployments", "replicasets"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods/log", "pods/exec"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]

---
# Bind role to users/groups
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: developer-binding
  namespace: development
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: developer@company.com
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
- kind: Group
  name: developers
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: developer-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io

---
# Read-only cluster role for monitoring
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: cluster-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["nodes", "namespaces"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
- apiGroups: ["metrics.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["nodes", "pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]

---
# Service account for applications
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: app-service-account
  namespace: production

---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: production
  name: app-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["configmaps"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["secrets"]
  verbs: ["get"]

---
# Implement admission controllers for additional security
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: admission-config
data:
  config.yaml: |
    apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
    kind: AdmissionConfiguration
    plugins:
    - name: ValidatingAdmissionWebhook
      configuration:
        apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
        kind: WebhookAdmissionConfiguration
        webhooks:
        - name: security-policy.company.com
          clientConfig:
            service:
              name: security-webhook
              namespace: kube-system
              path: "/validate"
          rules:
          - operations: ["CREATE", "UPDATE"]
            apiGroups: [""]
            apiVersions: ["v1"]
            resources: ["pods"]
```

## Docker Scenarios & Solutions

### 6. Multi-Stage Build Optimization

**Scenario**: Your Docker image is 2GB in size and takes too long to build and deploy. Optimize it using multi-stage builds and other techniques.

**Solution**:
```dockerfile
# Before: Single stage build (2GB)
# FROM node:16
# WORKDIR /app
# COPY . .
# RUN npm install
# RUN npm run build
# EXPOSE 3000
# CMD ["npm", "start"]

# After: Optimized multi-stage build
# Stage 1: Build stage
FROM node:16-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files first for better caching
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Copy source and build
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Production stage
FROM node:16-alpine AS production
WORKDIR /app

# Install dumb-init for proper signal handling
RUN apk add --no-cache dumb-init

# Create non-root user
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001

# Copy built application
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/package*.json ./

USER nextjs

EXPOSE 3000

ENTRYPOINT ["dumb-init", "--"]
CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]

# Build with cache mounts
docker build \
  --cache-from myapp:cache \
  --tag myapp:latest \
  --tag myapp:cache \
  --target production \
  .

# Multi-architecture build
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  --tag myapp:latest \
  --push .
```

### 7. Docker Security - Container Runtime Security

**Scenario**: You suspect a container might be compromised and running unauthorized processes. How would you monitor and detect such activities?

**Solution**:
```bash
# Real-time monitoring setup
# 1. Install Falco for runtime security monitoring
helm repo add falcosecurity https://falcosecurity.github.io/charts
helm install falco falcosecurity/falco \
  --set-file rules.rules=/path/to/custom-rules.yaml

# Custom Falco rules for container monitoring
# /path/to/custom-rules.yaml
- rule: Unexpected process in container
  desc: Detect unexpected processes in containers
  condition: >
    spawned_process and container and
    not proc.name in (node, npm, nginx, apache2, mysqld)
  output: >
    Unexpected process spawned in container 
    (user=%user.name command=%proc.cmdline container=%container.name image=%container.image)
  priority: WARNING

- rule: Container privilege escalation
  desc: Detect privilege escalation attempts
  condition: >
    spawned_process and container and
    proc.name in (sudo, su, setuid, setgid)
  output: >
    Privilege escalation attempt in container
    (user=%user.name command=%proc.cmdline container=%container.name)
  priority: HIGH

# 2. Runtime security with AppArmor/SELinux
# AppArmor profile for containers
cat > /etc/apparmor.d/docker-nginx << 'EOF'
#include <tunables/global>

profile docker-nginx flags=(attach_disconnected,mediate_deleted) {
  #include <abstractions/base>
  
  # Deny network admin capabilities
  deny capability net_admin,
  deny capability sys_admin,
  
  # Allow only necessary file access
  /usr/sbin/nginx r,
  /var/log/nginx/ rw,
  /etc/nginx/ r,
  
  # Deny access to host system
  deny /proc/sys/** wklx,
  deny /sys/** wklx,
}
EOF

# 3. Container monitoring script
cat > monitor-containers.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

# Monitor running processes in containers
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}" | while IFS=$'\t' read name image status; do
  if [[ "$name" != "NAMES" ]]; then
    echo "=== Monitoring container: $name ==="
    
    # Check running processes
    echo "Processes:"
    docker exec $name ps aux
    
    # Check network connections
    echo "Network connections:"
    docker exec $name netstat -tulpn 2>/dev/null || echo "netstat not available"
    
    # Check file system changes
    echo "File system changes:"
    docker diff $name
    
    echo "=========================="
  fi
done
EOF

# 4. Security scanning with Trivy
# Scan running containers
docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  aquasec/trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL nginx:latest

# 5. Implement container security policies
# Docker Compose with security constraints
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: myapp:latest
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true

## AWS Scenarios & Solutions

### 8. VPC Design for Multi-Tier Application

**Scenario**: Design a VPC architecture for a multi-tier application across 3 availability zones with public and private subnets, NAT gateways, and proper routing for high availability and security.

**Solution**:
```hcl
# VPC Configuration
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block           = "10.0.0.0/16"
  enable_dns_hostnames = true

```

### 9. AWS Security - IAM Policy Audit

**Scenario**: You suspect some IAM policies in your AWS account are overly permissive. How would you audit and remediate IAM permissions across your organization?

**Solution**:
```bash
# 1. AWS CLI scripts for IAM audit
#!/bin/bash
# iam-audit.sh

echo "=== IAM Security Audit Report ==="
echo "Generated on: $(date)"
echo ""

# Find users with admin access
echo "1. Users with Administrative Access:"
aws iam get-account-authorization-details --filter User | \
jq -r '.UserDetailList[] | select(.UserPolicyList[].PolicyDocument.Statement[]?.Effect == "Allow" and .UserPolicyList[].PolicyDocument.Statement[]?.Action == "*") | .UserName'

# Find roles with admin access
echo ""
echo "2. Roles with Administrative Access:"
aws iam list-roles | jq -r '.Roles[].RoleName' | while read role; do
  aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name "$role" | \
  jq -r '.AttachedPolicies[] | select(.PolicyArn | contains("AdministratorAccess")) | "Role: '$role' has AdministratorAccess"'
done

# Check for unused access keys
echo ""
echo "3. Unused Access Keys (older than 90 days):"
aws iam list-users | jq -r '.Users[].UserName' | while read user; do
  aws iam list-access-keys --user-name "$user" | \
  jq -r --arg user "$user" '.AccessKeyMetadata[] | select(.Status == "Active") | "User: \($user), Key: \(.AccessKeyId), Created: \(.CreateDate)"'
done

# 2. Implement least privilege policies
# Example: S3 access policy with conditions

## Advanced Kubernetes Security Solutions

### 15. Pod Security Standards Implementation

**Scenario**: You need to enforce that no containers run as root and all must use read-only root filesystems across the cluster.

**Solution**:
```yaml
# 1. Pod Security Standards with admission controllers
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: production
  labels:
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit: restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn: restricted

  Got it — let’s go deep and make you a **full-scale scenario-based Q\&A playbook** for:

* Terraform
* Kubernetes
* Docker
* AWS
* Azure
* Cloud Security (general & multi-cloud)
* CI/CD Security

I’ll keep the structure **Scenario → Guiding Questions → Solution Outline → Security Considerations**, so you can use it for **interview prep + hands-on practice**.

---

## **1. Terraform Scenarios**

**1.1** — **Remote State Security Breach**
**Scenario:** Terraform state is stored in S3 but no encryption is enabled; an audit flags it as a risk.
**Guiding Questions:**

* How do you secure the state immediately?
* How do you enforce this moving forward?
  **Solution:** Enable SSE-KMS on the S3 bucket, use `encrypt = true` in backend config, restrict bucket IAM policy, enable versioning, add DynamoDB locking.
  **Security:** Only allow access from Terraform pipeline role, block public access.

**1.2** — **Multi-Environment Management**
**Scenario:** Your team manually changes prod infrastructure in AWS Console, which drifts from Terraform config.
**Solution:** Run `terraform plan` regularly in CI/CD to detect drift, enforce `terraform apply` as only deployment path, enable AWS Config drift detection.
**Security:** Enable approval workflows for production applies.

**1.3** — **Sensitive Output Exposure**
**Scenario:** Terraform outputs DB passwords in plain text logs.
**Solution:** Use `sensitive = true` for outputs, fetch secrets from Vault instead of hardcoding, mask pipeline logs.
**Security:** Audit logs for past exposure.

**1.4** — **Module Version Management**
**Scenario:** Using community modules without version pinning causes unexpected changes.
**Solution:** Pin module versions in `source` with `?ref=version`.
**Security:** Scan external modules for malicious code.

**1.5** — **Terraform CI/CD Security**
**Scenario:** Developers run Terraform locally with admin keys.
**Solution:** Remove long-lived keys, use short-lived tokens via STS or Azure AD, run Terraform in controlled pipeline.
**Security:** Enforce IAM least privilege.

---

## **2. Kubernetes Scenarios**

**2.1** — **Privileged Container Risk**
**Scenario:** Pods in finance namespace run with `privileged: true`.
**Solution:** Remove privileged flag, drop capabilities, enforce PSP/OPA policies.
**Security:** Alert on privileged pod creation.

**2.2** — **Namespace Network Segmentation**
**Scenario:** A dev namespace pod can access prod DB.
**Solution:** Apply Kubernetes NetworkPolicies to restrict namespace egress/ingress.
**Security:** Default deny-all policies.

**2.3** — **Kubeconfig Leakage**
**Scenario:** A kubeconfig file is accidentally pushed to GitHub.
**Solution:** Rotate credentials, enable audit logging, use OIDC for authentication instead of static tokens.
**Security:** Secret scanning in repos.

**2.4** — **Image Pull Security**
**Scenario:** Pods pull from Docker Hub without signature verification.
**Solution:** Use a private registry with signed images (cosign/notary), set `imagePullSecrets`.
**Security:** Restrict registry access.

**2.5** — **Cluster Role Abuse**
**Scenario:** A service account with `cluster-admin` role is compromised.
**Solution:** Rotate tokens, limit RBAC to namespace level, audit for least privilege.
**Security:** Enable OPA Gatekeeper for RBAC rules.

**2.6** — **Unrestricted API Access**
**Scenario:** K8s API server allows public access on 6443.
**Solution:** Restrict via firewall, enable API auth via VPN or private endpoint.
**Security:** Monitor failed login attempts.

---

## **3. Docker Scenarios**

**3.1** — **Image Vulnerabilities in Production**
**Scenario:** Base image has CVEs.
**Solution:** Rebuild from patched base, scan regularly, use slim images.
**Security:** Automate scanning in pipeline.

**3.2** — **Secrets in Images**
**Scenario:** `.env` file baked into image layers.
**Solution:** Use `.dockerignore`, inject secrets at runtime, rebuild images.
**Security:** Scan history for secret leaks.

**3.3** — **Container Breakout Risk**
**Scenario:** Container runs with `--privileged`.
**Solution:** Remove flag, drop Linux capabilities.
**Security:** Use AppArmor/SELinux.

**3.4** — **Large Attack Surface**
**Scenario:** Image > 1GB with unused packages.
**Solution:** Use multi-stage builds, minimal base.
**Security:** Reduce OS package footprint.

**3.5** — **Unsigned Image Pulls**
**Scenario:** Registry compromise leads to malicious images.
**Solution:** Enforce signature verification with Docker Content Trust.
**Security:** Use private registries.

---

## **4. AWS Scenarios**

**4.1** — **S3 Public Data Leak**
**Scenario:** Public bucket contains PII.
**Solution:** Block Public Access, encrypt, rotate credentials.
**Security:** AWS Config rules for S3 ACL checks.

**4.2** — **IAM Over-Privileged User**
**Scenario:** Developer has `AdministratorAccess` in prod.
**Solution:** Apply least privilege, create role-based access.
**Security:** CloudTrail alerts on policy changes.

**4.3** — **Unencrypted RDS**
**Scenario:** RDS instance created without encryption.
**Solution:** Enable encryption at creation, migrate via snapshot.
**Security:** Enforce with SCP.

**4.4** — **EC2 Keypair Compromise**
**Scenario:** SSH private key leaked.
**Solution:** Replace key pair, use SSM Session Manager.
**Security:** Disable direct SSH.

---

## **5. Azure Scenarios**

**5.1** — **Public AKS Nodes**
**Scenario:** Node pool exposed to internet.
**Solution:** Use private clusters, NSG lockdown.
**Security:** Azure Policy to enforce.

**5.2** — **Open Storage Account**
**Scenario:** Blob container set to public read.
**Solution:** Disable public access, SAS tokens with expiry.
**Security:** Monitor with Azure Defender.

**5.3** — **No MFA for Admins**
**Scenario:** Global admin accounts lack MFA.
**Solution:** Enforce Conditional Access.
**Security:** Azure AD Identity Protection.

**5.4** — **Unrestricted SQL Server Access**
**Scenario:** SQL DB accessible from all IPs.
**Solution:** Restrict firewall to known IPs, private endpoints.
**Security:** Azure Policy compliance.

---

## **6. Cloud Security General**

**6.1** — **Unencrypted Data Stores**
**6.2** — **No Backup Policy**
**6.3** — **Multi-Cloud Drift in Security Controls**
**6.4** — **Inactive IAM Accounts**
**6.5** — **Default Passwords in SaaS**

---

## **7. CI/CD Security**

**7.1** — **Secrets in Jenkinsfile**
**7.2** — **No Artifact Signing**
**7.3** — **Pipeline Supply Chain Attack**
**7.4** — **Unscanned Builds**
**7.5** — **Over-Privileged Build Agents**

---

If you want, I can now **expand each category to 7–10 scenarios** with **full YAML/Terraform code examples, AWS CLI commands, and security automation scripts** so you have a *hands-on lab + interview set* in one place.

Do you want me to **go ahead and fully expand them** so this becomes a 50+ scenario prep guide? That would make it your complete reference.

The state file is corrupted during a network interruption, and you discover multiple engineers have been running `terraform apply` simultaneously without state locking. Production is partially down.

**Question:** Design a comprehensive recovery strategy that addresses immediate restoration, prevents future occurrences, and maintains zero-downtime operations.

**Solution Framework:**
```hcl
# Emergency state recovery
terraform state pull > corrupted-state-backup.json

# Implement remote backend with locking
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "company-terraform-state-prod"
    key            = "infrastructure/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-west-2"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-locks"
    encrypt        = true
    kms_key_id     = "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:account:key/12345"
  }
}

# State reconstruction using import
terraform import aws_instance.web_server[0] i-0123456789abcdef0
terraform import aws_lb.main arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:...

# Multi-workspace strategy
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  count         = terraform.workspace == "prod" ? 5 : 2
  instance_type = terraform.workspace == "prod" ? "m5.large" : "t3.micro"
  
  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
    ignore_changes = [
      ami, # Prevent AMI updates in production
    ]
  }
}
```

### **2. Cross-Account Resource Dependencies**
**Scenario:** You need to provision resources in Account A that depend on networking components in Account B, while maintaining least-privilege access and ensuring Account B teams can modify their infrastructure without breaking Account A's dependencies.

**Question:** Implement a solution that handles cross-account dependencies, permission management, and change coordination.

**Solution Framework:**
```hcl
# Account B - Networking (shared services)
resource "aws_vpc_peering_connection_accepter" "cross_account" {
  vpc_peering_connection_id = var.peering_connection_id
  auto_accept               = true
  
  tags = {
    Side = "Accepter"
    Name = "cross-account-peering"
  }
}

# Output for cross-account consumption
output "vpc_id" {
  value = aws_vpc.shared.id
}

output "private_subnet_ids" {
  value = aws_subnet.private[*].id
}

# Account A - Application infrastructure
data "terraform_remote_state" "networking" {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket = "shared-terraform-state"
    key    = "networking/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-west-2"
    
    # Cross-account role assumption
    role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT-B:role/TerraformCrossAccountRole"
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "app_servers" {
  count           = 3
  subnet_id       = data.terraform_remote_state.networking.outputs.private_subnet_ids[count.index]
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.app.id]
  
  # Dependency management
  depends_on = [data.terraform_remote_state.networking]
}
```

### **3. Terraform Sentinel Advanced Policy Enforcement**
**Scenario:** Your organization requires policies that prevent creation of resources outside business hours, enforce cost thresholds based on resource combinations, and ensure compliance with custom tagging schemes that vary by environment and team.

**Question:** Create Sentinel policies that handle these complex business rules while maintaining development velocity.

**Solution Framework:**
```python
import "time"
import "tfplan/v2" as tfplan
import "decimal"

# Policy: Restrict expensive resources outside business hours
business_hours_restriction = rule {
    time.now.hour >= 9 and time.now.hour = 1 and time.now.weekday  audit-results.json

# Stage 2: Vulnerability scanning stage
FROM aquasec/trivy:latest AS vulnerability-scanner
COPY --from=dependency-scanner /audit-results.json .
RUN trivy fs --format json --output vulnerability-report.json /

# Stage 3: Build stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app

# Create non-root user with specific UID
RUN addgroup -g 10001 -S appgroup && \
    adduser -u 10001 -S appuser -G appgroup

# Install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production && npm cache clean --force

COPY src/ ./src/
RUN npm run build

# Stage 4: Runtime image
FROM alpine:3.18 AS runtime
RUN apk add --no-cache nodejs npm

# Create application directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy non-root user from builder
RUN addgroup -g 10001 -S appgroup && \
    adduser -u 10001 -S appuser -G appgroup

# Copy application files
COPY --from=builder --chown=appuser:appgroup /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder --chown=appuser:appgroup /app/node_modules ./node_modules

# Set up proper file permissions
RUN chmod -R 755 /app && \
    chmod -R 644 /app/dist/* && \
    chmod 755 /app/dist

# Security hardening
RUN rm -rf /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/* && \
    rm -rf /usr/share/man /usr/share/doc

# Switch to non-root user
USER appuser:appgroup

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD node healthcheck.js || exit 1

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
```

### **7. Runtime Security with Behavioral Monitoring**
**Scenario:** You need to detect and respond to runtime anomalies in containerized applications, including process injection, unusual network connections, and file system modifications outside expected patterns.

**Question:** Implement a runtime security monitoring system that can detect and automatically respond to threats.

**Solution Framework:**
```yaml
# Falco rules for runtime security
- rule: Suspicious Process Activity in Container  
  desc: Detect suspicious process execution patterns
  condition: >
    spawned_process and container and
    (proc.name in (nc, netcat, curl, wget, nmap) or
     proc.args contains "bash -i" or
     proc.args contains "/dev/tcp" or
     proc.args contains "python -c")
  output: >
    Suspicious process activity (user=%user.name user_uid=%user.uid command=%proc.cmdline 
    container_id=%container.id container_name=%container.name image=%container.image.repository)
  priority: HIGH

- rule: Container File System Modification
  desc: Detect unexpected file system modifications
  condition: >
    container and modify and
    not proc.name in (node, npm, python, java) and
    fd.name startswith /app
  output: >
    Unexpected file modification in container (user=%user.name command=%proc.cmdline 
    file=%fd.name container=%container.name)
  priority: MEDIUM

## **AWS Advanced Security Scenarios**

### **8. Cross-Account IAM with Complex Policy Boundaries**
**Scenario:** Your organization has 50+ AWS accounts in an Organization. You need to implement a permission system where developers can assume roles across accounts based on team membership, but with permissions boundaries that prevent privilege escalation and ensure compliance with SOC2 requirements.

**Question:** Design an IAM strategy that handles cross-account access, permissions boundaries, and audit requirements.
